# Sun-Gift-Card

## Project Description
The focus of Team Fire for Project Two will be to build, test, and deploy an open loop gift card application. The application is to be easy and convenient to use. Once implemented, when on the website, via the web page, users will be met with a welcome message from the company and then prompted to login to their account. Those visiting the website for the first time will be asked to create an online customer account. Once logged into their account the user will be directed to a transaction screen. From the transaction screen, users will have the option(s) to update account information, add value to their account (gift card), order a new or replacement cards, view account activity and available balance, and to apply for and take advantage of any reward benefits the company may be offering for continued use of the gift card.

Our gift card is to be a restaurant gift card, one that can be used at any restaurant across the United States. Most restaurant gift cards have an expiration date. Ours will not. Once a customer creates an account with the company and a gift card has been issued, a customer is free to use the gift card as needed. They never have to worry about a bill not being paid due to an expiration date. There are to be no reload fees to add money to the account. Also, losing a gift card or having it stolen can be a headache, especially if you have failed to register it or keep the gift card number. If lost or stolen, a customer need only contact the company call center and verify who they are, and the missing card will be canceled and a replacement card issued. Finally, there is to be no inactivity fee for having failed to use the card. This is what separates our restaurant gift card from others and why ask you to consider honoring our proposal to create a new gift card web application.
