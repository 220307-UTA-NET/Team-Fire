# Sun-Gift-Card

## Project Description
Our gift card is to be a restaurant gift card, one that can be used at any restaurant across the United States. Most restaurant gift cards have an expiration date. Ours will not. Once a customer creates an account with the company and a gift card has been issued, a customer is free to use the gift card as needed. They never have to worry about a bill not being paid due to an expiration date. There are to be no reload fees to add money to the account. Also, losing a gift card or having it stolen can be a headache, especially if you have failed to register it or keep the gift card number. If lost or stolen, a customer need only contact the company call center and verify who they are, and the missing card will be canceled and a replacement card issued. Finally, there is to be no inactivity fee for having failed to use the card. This is what separates our restaurant gift card from others and why ask you to consider honoring our proposal to create a new gift card web application.
